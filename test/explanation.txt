Unaweza ukawa unajiuliza ni kwanini tofauti na kwenye project zilizopita kwa nini hii test folder tumeliweka outside the Etherium
directory... what is the reason.. THE REASON OF PUTTING THIS FOLDER OUTSIDE IS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO WRITE HERE MANY TESTS ONE 
OF THEM IS FOR Ethereum directory  AND OTHER ARE FOR OTHER PROJECT FOUND IN KICKSTART FOLDER LIKE WEB APP SIDE OF OUR APPLICATION..

ME PERSONALLY, I THINK THAT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT TESTS THAT WE HAVE FOR A SINGLE PROJECT SHOULD ALL BE PUT IN THE SAME LOCATION RATHER
THAN SCATTERING THEM ALL OUT THROUGHOUT OUR PROJECT... ko huko nyuma tulikuwa tunaandika /test directory kwenye same level/location
as that of Ethereum.. so in this since inside KICKSTART FOLDER we have many projects or purposes we have to write all their test inside
kickstart, this is why we have test folder outside etherium since we are going to write all the tests of all applications....
